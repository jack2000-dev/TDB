# Ask

Define the problem. Understand stakeholder expectations. Ask before doing.

> **Understand the problem before jumping into analysis.** Solve the right problem with the right answer and right data.

## Why this phase matters

The Ask phase determines whether the rest of the project is worth doing. A vague question yields a vague answer. The skill is converting fuzzy stakeholder requests into specific, answerable problems.

> "If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions." — attributed to Einstein

## Effective questions

- Define the problem you're trying to solve
- Confirm stakeholder expectations
- Focus on the actual problem; avoid distractions
- Collaborate; keep open communication
- See the whole situation in context

**Ask yourself:**

1. What are stakeholders saying their problems are?
2. How can I help resolve their questions?
3. What decision will be made with this analysis?
4. What does success look like?
5. What's the cost of being wrong?

## SMART Questions

| Letter | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **S**pecific | Single, narrow topic | "What features drive churn?" |
| **M**easurable | Quantifiable | "Reduce churn by 5%" |
| **A**ction-oriented | Drives a decision | "Should we launch onboarding emails?" |
| **R**elevant | Matters to the goal | Aligned with business OKR |
| **T**ime-bound | Has deadline | "By Q3" |

## Common problem types

| Type | What it asks | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Making predictions | What will happen next? | Will this customer churn? |
| Categorizing things | What group does X belong to? | Is this email spam? |
| Spotting unusual things | What's the outlier? | Which transactions are fraud? |
| Identifying themes | What patterns appear? | What do support tickets cluster around? |
| Discovering connections | What variables relate? | Does ad spend correlate with revenue? |
| Finding patterns | What recurs over time? | When do users drop off? |

## Structured Thinking

1. **Problem domain** — area of analysis (industry, product, geo)
2. **Scope of work (SOW)** — project doesn't start until SOW is approved
   - **Deliverables** — what work; what artifacts
   - **Milestones** — major progress markers
   - **Timeline** — duration estimates per step
   - **Reports** — how/when to update stakeholders
3. **Constraints** — time, data access, headcount, tooling
4. **Success criteria** — how you'll know you're done

## Five Whys

When stakeholders state a request, peel back to the root:

1. "We need a churn dashboard." — *Why?*
2. "Churn went up last month." — *Why does that matter?*
3. "The board is asking about retention." — *What decision will the board make?*
4. "Whether to fund the customer success team." — *What evidence supports that decision?*
5. "Cohort retention curves and segment-level churn drivers."

→ Build the curves and driver analysis, not just a generic dashboard.

## Take good notes

- **Facts** — concrete info: dates, names, specifics
- **Context** — relevant details to interpret facts
- **Unknowns** — questions to follow up on
- **Decisions** — what was agreed and by whom

**Example notes:**

- Project: collect customer flavor preference data
- Goal: offer/create more popular flavors
- Sources: cash register receipts + customer surveys (email)
- Target: Q2
- TODO: call manager about survey data location

## Example questions by audience

=== "Retail"

    - **Specific:** Do you currently use data to drive decisions? What kind?
    - **Measurable:** What percentage of sales is from your top-selling products?
    - **Action-oriented:** What decisions would you make with the right info?
    - **Relevant:** How often do you review business data?
    - **Time-bound:** How did data drive decisions this past year?

=== "Teacher"

    - **Specific:** What data do you use to build lessons?
    - **Measurable:** How well do benchmark scores correlate with grades?
    - **Action-oriented:** Do you share data with other teachers?
    - **Relevant:** Have you shared grading data with a class?
    - **Time-bound:** In the last five years, how often did you review prior-year data?

=== "Ice cream shop"

    - **Specific:** What data drives purchasing/inventory?
    - **Measurable:** Rank these factors on sales: price, flavor, season.
    - **Action-oriented:** Single factor where more data could increase sales?
    - **Relevant:** How do you communicate with customers?
    - **Time-bound:** YoY sales growth for the last 3 years?

## Red flags during Ask

- Stakeholder can't articulate the decision
- "Just send me everything" requests
- Conflicting goals across stakeholders
- Deadline before scope is clear
- "Make the data say X" — that's confirmation bias, push back
