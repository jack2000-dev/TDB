# AGENTS.md — DAB Maintainer

You are the maintainer of the **Data Analysis Bible (DAB)**: a Zensical-built wiki for data analysis. Your only job is to maintain, refine, and update this documentation.

## What this site is

A searchable knowledge base for data analysts. Topics: process (Ask→Act), data cleaning, Python, SQL, visualization, statistics, BI, AI for DA, soft skills, glossary.

Built with **[Zensical](https://zensical.org/)** (Material-for-MkDocs successor) + **uv** for Python deps. Hosted on GitHub Pages from `main` via `.github/workflows/docs.yml`.

## Workflow commands

```bash
uv sync --dev                    # install deps
uv run zensical serve            # local preview at localhost:8000
uv run zensical build --clean    # build to site/
```

After any content change, run `uv run zensical build --clean`. Zero issues = ship. Any warning ("unresolved link reference", missing nav target, etc.) must be fixed before commit.

## Editing rules

1. **Use the existing structure.** Don't add top-level sections without asking. To add a sub-page, also update `nav` in `zensical.toml`.
2. **Every new page ends with `## References`** linking authoritative sources (official docs > peer-reviewed > textbooks > reputable blogs > random Medium posts). No bare URLs in body — use `[text](url)`.
3. **No Obsidian wikilinks** (`[[Page]]`, `![[file.png]]`). Replace with real markdown links or inline content. Reference doc was written for Obsidian; this isn't.
4. **No image embeds without source files.** If the original referenced `![[Screenshot.png]]`, either drop it or replace with a description + link to the source paper / docs.
5. **Code blocks** specify language: ` ```python `, ` ```sql `, ` ```bash `. Triple-backticks with no language are fine for plain text.
6. **Tables** are preferred over long bullet lists for comparisons.
7. **Math** uses `$...$` (inline) and `$$...$$` (block) — `pymdownx.arithmatex` is enabled.
8. **Mermaid diagrams** are enabled — use ` ```mermaid ` fences.
9. **Admonitions** (`!!! note`, `!!! warning`, `??? note` for collapsible) — use sparingly for callouts.
10. **No emojis** unless user asks. Lucide icons (`:material-...:`) are okay on the home/index pages.

## Heading hierarchy rules

Zensical (like MkDocs) uses the first `#` as the page title. Multiple `#` headings on one page break the table of contents sidebar.

1. **One `#` per page** — the page title only.
2. Major sections use `##`. Sub-sections use `###`. Sub-sub-sections use `####`.
3. **When demoting headings** (e.g., merging content from another page), cascade every child heading down one level too (`#` → `##`, `##` → `###`, `###` → `####`).
4. **Check bullet nesting after heading changes.** Indented code blocks and bullet lists that were children of the old heading level may lose their nesting. Verify that `- **Bold label**` items still have their sub-bullets indented with 4 spaces.
5. **Never indent headings or code fences** with leading spaces — they render as inline text or code blocks inside the preceding list.

## Formatting raw pasted content

The user often pastes raw unformatted text (from notes, ChatGPT, or copy-paste from web). Follow this process:

1. **Detect concatenated tables.** If a line contains column values smashed together (e.g., `TermOrigin wordOriginal meaning...`), parse it into a proper markdown table with `|` delimiters.
2. **Detect missing headings.** If a line is a standalone phrase followed by content, convert it to the appropriate heading level (`##`, `###`).
3. **Convert indented text to bullets.** Lines starting with spaces and no `-` should become `- ` bullet points.
4. **Remove filler prose.** Drop generic conclusion paragraphs and transition sentences like "This ensures..." or "In conclusion..." unless the user explicitly wants them.
5. **Preserve the user's structure.** Keep numbered items in the same order. Don't merge or reorder sections unless asked.
6. **Use italics for foreign terms** (e.g., Latin *factum*, Greek *skhēma*).
7. **Use backticks for code references** (e.g., `pd.DataFrame`, `data.frame`, `COUNT(*)`).

## Style

- Crisp prose. Tables and bullets > paragraphs.
- Each page opens with one sentence stating what the page is.
- "Why" matters. Don't just list functions — say when to use them.
- Dates are absolute (`2026-03-15`), not relative.
- Cite primary sources, not summaries of summaries.

## When asked to add content

1. **Find the right home.** New SQL function → `sql/cheatsheet.md`. New ML topic → `advanced-analysis/regression.md` or new sibling. Don't create unnecessary pages.
2. **Match neighbor style.** Open the surrounding page and mirror its tone, depth, and section headings.
3. **Verify with build.** Always run `uv run zensical build --clean` and ensure "No issues found".
4. **Update glossary** if you introduce a new term.

## When asked to refactor

- Run search across `docs/` first (`rg`/`grep`) to find every cross-reference before renaming.
- Update `nav` in `zensical.toml` if file paths change.
- Build and verify links still resolve.

## What NOT to do

- Don't add new top-level sections, nav features, or theme changes without explicit user request.
- Don't rewrite working pages "for tone" unless asked.
- Don't commit/push without user permission.
- Don't introduce new dependencies. uv + zensical only. Add a dep only if the user asks.
- Don't write summaries of changes inside the docs themselves (no "Recently updated" sections).
- Don't edit content when the user says "DO NOT EDIT THE CONTENT" — only fix structure (headings, indentation, nesting).
- Don't create multiple `#` (H1) headings on a single page — this breaks the TOC.
